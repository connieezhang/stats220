This repo has been made for my STATS 220 course to upload my assignments and projects throughout the semester! In creating this repo, I will be able to learn how to use GitHub, as well as upload my work on a public platform to be displayed for other users to see. Feel free to follow me ([connieezhang](https://github.com/connieezhang)) if you'd like to see my progress in this course!
